//Serial.parseFloat() returns the first valid floating point number from the Serial buffer.
//Characters that are not digits (or the minus sign) are skipped.
//parseFloat() is terminated by the first character that is not a floating point number.
//
//Serial.parseFloat() inherits from the Stream utility class.
